### Summary:
- A cute snake clone I made in PyGame! It's nothing special, it's just snake. 
- My objective with this project was to dip my toes in game development from a coding and artistic point of view. 
- Since I didn't use a game engine, all the mechanics were coded from scratch. This was more challenging than I thought! Fixing animation bugs was especially rough, but very rewarding in the end when the game looked good.
- For the art, I hand drew all the sprites and assets in Aseprite
- I composed the background music too! Composed and rendered in FL Studio. The music is titled "Earthen Pot" and I wrote it some time in 2020. For you esoteric music nerds out there, the piece is Macrotonal and is written in 7-TET. I've heard it so many times at this point that it just sounds normal to me but it might be a little jarring to y'all when listening to it for the forst time.

If you want to run this file on your system, make sure the "Art" folder is in the same folder as the python script. Also, you would need the `pygame` package for this to run. You can install it with pasting and running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.

Thanks! Interesting expansion of this project coming soon!
